	"antelope": "Antelopes are deer-like herbivores that vary enormously in size, depending on the species. They have long legs, a slender neck, and large ears. One of the characteristic features of antelopes are their horns, which have a bone core covered in keratin (the same substance which makes our hair and fingernails). Males always have horns, but in some species, the females do not. Some species have horns that twist in intricate spirals, some are ridged or corrugated, and others grow in wide sweeping curves finishing in a sharp point. Their horns may grow up to 5 ft (1.5 m) in length."
